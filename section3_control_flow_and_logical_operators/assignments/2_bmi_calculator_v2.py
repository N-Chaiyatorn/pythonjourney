"""
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Above 35 they are clinically obese.

### Example Input
```
weight = 85
height = 1.75
```
### Example Output
```
85 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
