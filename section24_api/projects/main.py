# find your latitude and longitude: https://www.latlong.net/

# Write a program to send the email to lookup if you could see the ISS

# Assumption
# 1. you can see the ISS is close if your position is within +5 or -5 degrees of the ISS position
# 2. you can only see the ISS during the night time (before sunrise time, after sunset time)

# BONUS: run the code every 60 seconds.
