"""
You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that __1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters__ of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

__number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 = 1.6__

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, __the result should be rounded up to 2 cans__.

IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.

### Example Input
```
test_h = 3
test_w = 9
```
### Example Output
```
You'll need 6 cans of paint.
```
