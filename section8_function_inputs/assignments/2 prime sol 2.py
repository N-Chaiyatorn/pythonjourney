"""
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.


### Example Input 1
```
73
```
### Example Output 1
```
It's a prime number.
```
### Example Input 2
```
75
```
### Example Output 2
```
It's not a prime number.
