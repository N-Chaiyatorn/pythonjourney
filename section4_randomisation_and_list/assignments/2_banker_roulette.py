"""
You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

Line 24 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

### Example Input
```
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
```
Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

### Example Output
```
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
```
